cryptocurrency market and keep an eye on his/her buisness

**Welcome to the CryptoV project! :kissing:**

The app idea is simple:
+ The ability to access the information about crypto assets
+ Track some market changes in the 'live mode'

Speaking about the app, there are three pages and each of them represents its own functionality.
The pages are connected with each other with a help of routing. 
___
## *Main page (Overview page): :alien:
   1. The user can track the market changes every minute or by reloading the page
   2. Every crypto asset can be added to the portfolio anytime
   3. There is an opportunity to delete each asset from the portfolio list
   4. The modal window is for the user to input the exact number of assets to add
   5. Top assets are shown at the top of the page 
   6. There is a user's current balance which is updated due to portfolio list
   7. Portfolio assets and user's balance are available after the page is reloaded
   8. The pagination helps to get access to the fresh assets
   
## *Crypto Data page (page for a single asset): :+1:
   1. The user gets an access to the full info about an asset
   2. An asset can be added to the portfolio directly from this page
   3. There is a diagram of the wanted asset market changes within a month
   4. The 'Get back' button allows the user to go to the main page anytime

## *404 (page not found): :zzz:
   1. Page not found represents the situation when the url isn't valid
   2. There is a 'Get back' button to go to the main page
